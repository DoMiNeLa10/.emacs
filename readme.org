#+TITLE: DoMiNeLa10's .emacs

* About this .emacs
This is my config for GNU Emacs. I hold my settings specific to my
Arch instalation in ~.emacs.d/config/local.el~. Extensions come with
byte compiled files, so they can work faster. The table with
customized keybindings is [[file:documentation/changed-keybindings.org][here]].

* This config is used on these operating systems:
- Arch GNU/Linux
- Android 5.0 with Termux
- Multiple versions of Windows (using the native build from the GNU FTP)

* Links to extensions included in this config:
