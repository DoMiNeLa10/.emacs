|------------+--------+------------------------+---------------------------------------|
| C-h        | global | (delete-backward-char) | bash uses this key like that          |
| M-h        | global | (backward-kill-word)   | this is supposed to be similar to M-d |
| C-?        | global | (help-command)         | C-h was overwritten                   |
| C-x C-h    | global | (mark-paragraph)       | M-h was overwritten                   |
| C-c TAB    | global | (indent-buffer)        | Just like in web-mode                 |
| C-c i      | global | (my-impatient-mode)    | Convinience                           |
| M-h        | org    | (backward-kill-word)   | For consistency                       |
| C-x C-h    | org    | (org-mark-element)     | ^                                     |
