DoMiNeLa10's .emacs

This is my .emacs that I use, the only difference is the lack of font and browse-url settings specific to my arch instalation.
I use this configuration on these operating systems:
 - Arch GNU/Linux
 - Android 5.0 with Termux
 - Multiple versions of Windows (using the native build from the GNU FTP)

I included and compiled extensions that I use in order to have everything I use.
