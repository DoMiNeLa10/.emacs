DoMiNeLa10's .emacs

This is a modified version of my .emacs file. I removed some system specific things that might not work on other systems.

I inluded a template of my function to auto-connect to irc and auto identify with NickServ. It launches automatically when Emacs is started as a daemon.

I included the extensions that I use.
